# Kotlin is Delightful :-)

## Hugh Greene <hughg@tameter.org>  

### June 2017

.footnote[Presentation made with [remarkjs](https://remarkjs.com/).]

In this talk I'm going to introduce you to the delightful programming language, Kotlin.

I'm not going to walk exhaustively through the basic syntax, just show you the coolest bits :-)
with some asides for minor cool features.

# Why program in Kotlin?

---

# Why program in Kotlin?

--

It's not the silver bullet.

--

There are many causes of project failure (or success)  
and the choice of programming language and ecosystem  
is only one.

--

However, good tools make a developer's life more pleasant.

---

# Why program in Kotlin?

## Because it's delightful!

--

... and also

* cross-ecosystem

* powerful

* parsimonious

* pragmatic

* easy to learn

* professional

???

(The opportunity to use the word "parsimonious" is in itself delightful :-)
Parsimony here means "economy in the use of means to an end": rather than having multiple ways to do things,
it tends to use the same constructs to acheive several ends.

Pragmatic in that it gives you clear, easy ways to do many things.

Easy to learn if you know Java, Groovy, C#, Swift, and probably C++.
Worth learning if you know JavaScript or TypeScript.

Professional in the sense that it has good tooling (IntelliJ, Eclipse; Maven, Gradle), commercial support, and is stable.

# Delightful features (IMHO)

Cross-ecosystem

Type inference

Types are non-nullable by default

No checked exceptions

Inline functions + lambdas = block-structure macros & type-safe DSLs/builders

Property delegation

Class delegation

Coroutines

        val myName = when(splitNick?.size) {
            null -> name
            // At this point Kotlin knows splitNick is not null
            1 -> nickname `?:` name
            else -> splitNick.map { it.first() }.joinToString()
        }
        println("Hello, my name is $myName")
    }
}
```
]

`val` declares a constant reference variable, `var` declares a mutable one.

Declaring constructor parameters with `val`/`var` generates properties
and assigns them on construction.

If you call a Java API, Kotlin lets you treat it as nullable or not.
If you treat it as non-nullable and it is in fact `null`, you'll get a
`NullPointerException` as soon as you try to use it.

The compiler knows about various standard Java annotations for annotating nullability
so, if a libary you're calling makes use of them, the compiler will take them into
account to give you warnings/errors when you call methods and handle return values.

This slide also shows type inference; see following slides for more detail.

// size inferred as Double
var `size` = 10.0
fun foo1() {
    size = 11 // compile error
}

fun <T> forEach(items: Collection<T>, block: (T) -> Unit) {
    // item inferred as T
    for (`item` in items) block(item)
}

fun foo2() {
    // it inferred as Int
    forEach(listOf(1, 2, 3)) { print(`it` + 1) }
}
```

// Return type defaults to Unit (like void)
fun <T> maybeDo(o: T?, block: (T) -> Unit) {
    if (`o != null`) {
        // o inferred as T (not T?)
        block(`o`)
    }
}

fun throwAnything(o: Any): Nothing = when(o) {
    `is Throwable` -> throw o // o inferred as Throwable
    `is String` -> throw Exception(o) // o inferred as String
    else -> throw Exception(o.toString())
}
```
]

???

`(T) -> Unit` is a function type, taking an instance of `T` and returning
with no result.

The definition of `throwAnything` shows the shorthand for a single-expression function.

The return type of `Nothing` means "does not return".  The compiler will, for example,
warn you about dead code if you have any code after a call to function returning `Nothing`.

---

.left-column[

.right-column[
# No checked exceptions
]
.clear[
The theory of checked exceptions is: they are part of an API, so they should be explicit.

* That's only useful when there's something you can do about a particular case of error.

* It's only useful if the exceptions distinguish each kind of error.

* Layering is verbose, with `try/catch` and per-layer exception classes.
]

???

Maybe if a language also provided pre- and post-condition checking, or
software transactional memory, they would be more useful.

# Inline + lambdas: "macros"

.clear[
```
 `inline` fun <T: Closeable?> T.autoClose(block: (T) -> Unit) {
    var caught: Boolean = false
    try {
        block(this)
    } catch (e: Exception) {
        caught = true
        try { this?.close() }
        catch (e2: Exception) { e.addSuppressed(e2); throw e }
    } finally {
        if (!caught) { this?.close() }
    }
}

fun getFirstLineStartingWith(fileName: String, prefix: String): String? {
    FileReader(File("foo.txt")).autoClose {
        it.useLines { it.forEach { if (it.startsWith(prefix)) `return` it } }
    }
    return null
}
```
]

???

`autoClose` is declared as an extension function on `T`.

`autoClose`, `useLines`, `forEach` and the innermost block are all inlined
into `getFirstLineStartingWith`, so the `return` will return from that
function.

Keywords `noinline` and `crossinline` allow you to declare restrictions
on how function-typed arguments can be inlined.

.clear[
```
fun sort(header: HTMLTableCellElement): Unit = `TODO()`

fun getPeopleTable(entries: Map<String, Int>): HTMLElement {
    fun TR.sortableTh(block: TR.() -> Unit) {
        block()
        onClickFunction = { sort(it.target as HTMLTableCellElement) }
    }
    return document.create.`div` {
        h2 { +"People" }
        table {
            tr { sortableTh { +"Name" }; sortableTh { +"Age" } }
            for ((name, age) in entries) {
                tr { th { +name }; th { +age.toString() } }
            }
        }
    }
}
```
]

???

`sortableTh` is an extension function, and accepts a `block` which is itself
an extension function.

The `TODO()` function always throws a "not implemented" exception.

Within each block, only the methods for the appropriate HTML elements are available.

The "unary plus" operator is used to insert text.

# Property delegation: lazy

inline fun retry(count: Int, block: () -> Unit) {
    val exceptions `by lazy` { LinkedList<Exception>() }
    for (i in 0 until count) {
        try { block(); return }
        catch (e: Exception) { exceptions.add(e) }
    }
    val message = when (exceptions.size) {
        0 -> "Count must be a positive integer"
        1 -> throw exceptions[0]
        else -> "Failed after $count retry attempts"
    }
    throw RuntimeException(message).apply {
        for (e in exceptions) addSuppressed(e)
    }
}
```
]

???

`lazy` is a delegate from the Kotlin standard library, along with `observable` and `vetoable`

In this example, the linked list of exceptions is not created until it's needed.

interface HasSqlId {

 `object` DbConfig {
    lateinit var url: String
}

class Vehicle(override val id: Int) : HasSqlId {
    override val table = "vehicle"
    override val pkCol = "id"
    var type: String `by sql()`
    var make: String by sql()
    var model: String by sql()
}
```
]

???

Here's an example using a custom delegate.  A delegate object has to provide one or two functions,
`getValue` and `setValue`, _or_ a `provideDelegate` function which returns an object providing
`getValue`/`setValue`.

            it.prepareStatement("select 1 from ${thisRef.table} where 1 = 0").use {
                it.execute() // throws if table doesn't exist
            }
        }
        return SqlDelegate()
    }
}

fun `sql()` = SqlDelegateFactory()
```

class SqlDelegate : ReadWriteProperty<HasSqlId, String> {
    private fun getStmt(thisRef: HasSqlId, property: KProperty<*>) =
            "SELECT ${property.name} FROM ${thisRef.table} WHERE ${thisRef.pkCol} = ?"
            
    override fun getValue(thisRef: HasSqlId, property: KProperty<*>): String {
        DriverManager.getConnection(DbConfig.url).use {
            it.prepareStatement(getStmt(thisRef, property)).use {
                it.setInt(1, thisRef.id)
                it.executeQuery().use {
                    return if (it.first()) it.getString(property.name)
                    else throw IllegalArgumentException("ID ${thisRef.id} not found")
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    override fun setValue(thisRef: HasSqlId, property: KProperty<*>, value: String) = TODO()
}
```
]

???

Delegates don't have to implement the `ReadWriteProperty` or `ReadOnlyProperty` interfaces,
they just have to provide `operator fun getValue`/`setValue` with the right signature.

# Class delegation

class LimitedIterator<T>(
        val limit: Int,

): Iterator<T> `by wrapped` {
    private var count = 0

    `override` fun next(): T {
        if (++count > limit) {
            throw IllegalStateException("No more than $limit items can be read")
        }
        return wrapped.next()
    }

    `override` fun hasNext(): Boolean {
        return count < limit && wrapped.hasNext()
    }
    
    // No override of 'remove', so it's just delegated to 'wrapped'.
}
```
]

???

Class delegation makes re-use by composition as easy as re-use by inheritance, which I think is a subtle but really
powerful thing.

# Coroutines
]
.clear[
Suspend execution of a code block without blocking a thread; resume on any thread later.

* Compiler converts the block to a state machine.

* Suspend/resume at calls to any `suspend fun`.

Extension of C#2/ES6 generators/`yield`, C#5/ES7 `async`/`await`, Go channels/`select`, ...

Your code can freely customise dispatch of coroutines.

Coroutines can be serialisable so

* "any thread" can be in another process;

* "later" can be after reloading from persistent store.
]

???

No big restructuring of your code needed -- a coroutine block of code looks much like a normal code block.

This example assumes the existence of `external` definitions for jQuery, and of
the definition for JavaScript's `Promise` type in the Kotlin standard library.

`if` can be an expression; using `when` would be even shorter here, but still
easily understandable.

# Syntactic sugar

---

# Syntactic sugar 1/2

Terse constructors and properties

Constructors and factory methods look identical

Extension methods

Named arguments

Data classes and destructuring

Sealed classes

Strings: templates and multi-line

Nullable handling (smart type inference, platform types, `?.`, `?:`, `let`, `lateinit` etc.)

Ranges

`when` (super-`switch`/`if-else`)

???

Named arguments are automatically available for any Kotlin function, including constructors.
Doesn't work for calling into Java because Java may not retain argument names.

Sealed classes only allow direct subclasses defined in the same file.
Use for partially restricted hierarchies, e.g., HTTP status codes:
there are five standard subclasses, but some server implementations
such as IIS add their own sub-status codes such as
`404.4 No handler was found to serve the request`.

Data classes let you define final classes with auto-generated (but overridable)
`equals`, `hashCode`, and `toString` methods.

---

# Syntactic sugar 2/2

`var name: Type`: ordered so long types don’t obscure the name

Interfaces can have behavior (but not state)

lambda-to-SAM for JVM can be explicit (`val run = Runnable { ... }`)

Explicit syntax for `override` and `tailrec`

Explicit singletons

Operator overloading

Infix functions

Calling multiple methods on an object instance (`with { ... }`)

`this@scope`

`return`/`continue`/`break@scope`

???

SAM = Interface with a Single Abstract Method, which can be automatically implemented
by a suitable lambda.

Explicit syntax for method overrides and tail recursion is good because
it means the compiler will tell you if the code changes such that your
method is no longer an override (because the base method changed or was
removed) or is no longer tail-recursive.

Lots of operators you can override, including `get` (like C++ `operator []`)
and `invoke` (like C++ `operator ()`).  There's no equivalent of C++'s
`operator *`/ `operator ->` but delegated properties are similar.
You can't define your own operators, which is a good thing for eas of
understanding by other developers.

There are various other helper methods like `with`; use carefully to avoid
code which is confusing to Kotlin newbies.

`this@scope` lets you pick which object to use as `this` when you're deep in
nested lambdas, functions, or clases.

`return`/`continue`/`break@scope` let you jump out only part way from
multiple levels of inline lambada nesting.

# Nice surprises

Co- and contra-variance at both declaration and use sites.

If-not-null (`?:`, etc.) can `throw`/`return`/`continue`/`break`

Generic type information is erased

* ... but there’s a shorthand to get it in inline functions (`<reified T>`)

Multi-file classes (like C++, or C# `partial class`; JVM only)

Doc tool uses Markdown, can include compiled function bodies as samples.

# Not-so-nice(?) surprises

No ternary operator: `if` is an expression

No collection literals: `listOf(1, 2, 3, ...)`, `mapOf(1 to "one", ...)`

No implicit numeric conversions, not even widening

* ... to avoid surprises comparing JVM boxed values of different types

Classes final by default

* ... because extensibility should be an explicit API decision

* ... compiler option/plugin for "open by default"

`protected` members not visible to other instances of type/subtype

Ranges are closed: `0..10` is "0, 2, ..., 10", not "... 9".

???

Ternary operator and collection literals may be added in future; see forums / surveys.

Commercially supported by creators, JetBrains

* Used internally for their products

Well supported even in free version of IntelliJ IDEA

... but JavaScript debugging is painful without commercial version of IntelliJ IDEA.

Also integrates with Eclipse, Android Studio, Maven, Gradle

* You can even write Gradle scripts in Kotlin!

Compiler is open source (Apache licence)

Active communities on forums, StackOverflow, Slack, etc.

Constructor argument definitions can define properties at the same time.

Constructors and factory methods have the same syntax, so switching needs little code change.

Function argument names are automatically argument keywords.

The syntax for what look like static methods from other languages  
is actually for instance methods on a per-class singleton `companion object`,  
which can implement interfaces.

Properties, functions, delegated properties, extension functions, and classes  
can exist at top-level, within a class, or within a function.  
Within a class, all these kinds of function are overridable.

Property delegation uses objects and function signatures, not specific classes or interfaces,  
so you can use singleton objects and/or extension functions for delegates.

Coroutines can be extended to async calls, sequence generators, channels, thread pools, etc.
